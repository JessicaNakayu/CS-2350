                    Hello! I am Jessica Nakayu, and I am a current student at Weber State University. I am majoring in Computer Science and hope to graduate with my degree by 2026. When I am not working on schoolwork I am a wife to my wonderful husband and a mother to my three kids. I love spending my free time with them like going on adventures, and doing all sorts of activities.
